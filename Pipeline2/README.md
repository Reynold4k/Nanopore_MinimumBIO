# Pipeline 2

Once you have executed the initial analysis with your gene expression counts and identified potential hits, itâ€™s time to further investigate them using AlphaFold for protein structure prediction. Below are detailed instructions for running the script while ensuring the relevant paths are properly set.

### Setting Up Paths
## Create a new conda environment
```bash
conda create -n alphafold_env python=3.9
conda activate alphafold_env
```

## Install canu, if it is not installed:
```bash
wget https://github.com/marbl/canu/releases/download/v2.2/canu-2.2.Linux-amd64.tar.bz2
tar -xvjf canu-2.2.Linux-amd64.tar.bz2
export PATH=$PATH:path/to/your/canu-2.2/bin
```
## Step A: Extracting potential hits into a new folder

#Edit file path in the script:

```bash
#Path to your bam files
PARENT_DIR="/path/to/your/experiments/R3/step2"
#Path to the new folder: potential hits
OUTPUT_DIR="/path/to/your/experiments/potential_hit"
#Annotation files
ANN_FILE="path/to/your/reference/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.110.gtf"

Hit_LOCATIONS=$(awk -v gene_name="your_interested potential hits name" '$3 == "exon" && $0 ~ gene_name {print "chr"$1":"$4"-"$5}' "$ANN_FILE")

```

```bash

bash ./a_extract_reads.pbs

```

If running without error, you will see:

## Step B: Error Correction, trimming, unitigging, Assembly

#Edit file path in the script:

OUTPUT_DIR="/path/to/your/experiments/potential_hit"

```bash

bash ./b_correction_canu.pbs

```

It won't take a long time, but you need to wait till the contigs files are created!!!

You must wait until seeing the contigs file:

Then execute the translation script, but still need to change the path first:

contig_fasta_file = "/path/to/your/corrected.contigs.fasta"
output_protein_file = "/path/to/your/protein_sequences_long.fasta"

```bash
python3 translation.py
```

If succeed, you will see:

Make a blast online to check whether it is still the potential hits that you extracted in the Step A via:

## Step C Finding overlapped region where could be indicated as the drug binding sites
